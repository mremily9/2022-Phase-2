# Unit Testing

What even is unit testing? Unit testing is the process of testing a single unit of code. This is done by writing a test that verifies that a single unit of code works as expected.

Let's start by setting up a simple test project to verify that our dummy controller is working as expected.

## Setup

Start by creating a new project in the existing solution by doing the following:

![picture 1](images/db72b61a9221d225b3237255bec025bcb9a98bcd51733b064d3bbdc89be7c4ff.png)  

Then you want to add an NUnit test project:

You should then see the following contents in the project:

And by clicking run tests:

Horray! The default test in the project passes. Happy testing!
